### ðŸ“… Course Timeline

* **Started:** August 12, 2024
* **Completed:** September 10, 2024

### ðŸŽ¯ About the Course

This course provides an in-depth guide to testing React applications using **React Testing Library** along with tools like **Vitest**, **Jest**, and **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**. It covers the full testing workflowâ€”from fundamentals to advanced practicesâ€”ensuring your applications are reliable, maintainable, and production-ready.

Topics covered include:

* Writing robust and maintainable tests with React Testing Library
* Mocking API responses using MSW and generating mock data with `@mswjs/data` and `@faker-js`
* Simulating user interactions in test environments
* Testing advanced use cases: authentication, state management, and routing
* Applying refactoring techniques to make code more testable and maintainable
* Enforcing code quality with ESLint

### ðŸ’¡ Why I Took This Course

I took this course to strengthen my front-end testing skills and ensure that my React applications are **well-tested, reliable, and resilient to change**. The practical, real-world scenarios helped me understand how to structure tests that reflect how users interact with appsâ€”improving both the confidence in my code and its long-term maintainability.
